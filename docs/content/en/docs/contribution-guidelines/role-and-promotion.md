## Roles and Promotion Mechanism in the Koupleless Community
The roles in the Koupleless community are based on the organization model of Apache open-source projects, with each component (SOFAArk, Arklet, ModuleController, ArkCtl) having its own set of roles. The roles, from lowest to highest, are **Contributor, Committer, PMC (Project Management Committee), and Maintainer** <br/>

| Role | Responsibilities and Permissions | Promotion Mechanism to Higher Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contributor  | All students who provide **Issue**s, answer Issue**s**, operate externally, submit **documentation** content, or submit any **code** are **Contributors** of the corresponding component. Contributors have the permission to submit Issues, reply to Issues, submit content to the official website or documentation, submit code (excluding code review), and publish articles externally. | When a Contributor has merged enough code or documentation content, they can be promoted to **Committer** by a vote of PMC members of the component. When a Contributor has answered enough Issues or participated in enough operational activities, they can also be voted as a Committer by PMC members. |
| Committer    | All students who actively answer **Issue**s, operate externally, submit **documentation** content, or submit **code** have the potential to be voted as **Committer**s by PMC members based on their activity level. Committers additionally have responsibilities and permissions for code **review**, technical proposal review, and Contributor **cultivation**.  | Committers who have shown long-term active involvement or outstanding contributions can be promoted to PMC members of the corresponding component by a vote of PMC members.                   |
| PMC          | Students who make **sustained contributions** and are **particularly active** in the corresponding component have the opportunity to be promoted to **PMC** members. PMC members additionally have responsibilities and permissions for **RoadMap** formulation, technical **proposal** and code **review**, Issue and **iteration** management, Contributor and Committer **cultivation**, etc. |  |
| Maintainer   | Maintainers have additional permissions for key management and repository management. Apart from this, they have **equivalent responsibilities and permissions** as PMC members in other aspects. |  |
