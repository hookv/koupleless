## Documentation Contribution
Maintaining user documentation, technical documentation, and website content is a collective effort of every contributor in the community. Any student who contributes to any document or website content is considered a contributor, and based on their activity, they may have the opportunity to become a Committer or even a PMC member of Koupleless, jointly leading the technical evolution of Koupleless.

## Issue Submission and Response Contribution
Any issues, bugs, new features, or improvements encountered during usage should be reported via GitHub Issues. Community members take turns each day to follow up on issues. Anyone who raises or responds to issues is a contributor to Koupleless. Contributors who actively respond to issues may be promoted to Committer status, and exceptionally active contributors may even be promoted to PMC members, jointly leading the technical evolution of Koupleless.

### Issue Templates
There are two templates for Koupleless (including SOFAArk) Issues: "Question or Bug Report" and "Feature Request". ![image.png](https://intranetproxy.alipay.com/skylark/lark/0/2023/png/671/1694089517798-6930c476-c675-44c1-8e76-9f98166f0645.png#clientId=uab052d98-bf90-4&from=paste&height=182&id=u345d4d11&originHeight=364&originWidth=2358&originalType=binary&ratio=2&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=156188&status=done&style=none&taskId=ufbd6f12c-1e4f-4de5-a74c-a951ddabfac&title=&width=1179)
